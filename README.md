# Bamazon

an amazon like store that runs in command line using  node.js

Node.js & MySQL
Introduction
I created an Amazon-like storefront app, called Bamazon, using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

This app takes in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

The app first displays a list of all of the available products, their costs, and current stock. ScreenShot

The app asks the following things from the user.

product ID
the amount the user wants to purchase ScreenShot
The app will display the stock before your purchase, what you are buying, how many, and the unit cost.

Then it will display the total cost and ask if you want to purchase another item. ScreenShot

It must be ran in the command line.

Type in node main.js to start the app.

These are the npm packages I used and are needed to run the app

fs package in node
prompt
mysql
to install these npm packages run the following command.

npm install 

if that does not work run these commands one at a time.
npm install prompt
npm install mysql
